This is an Android sample project on MVVM(Model View View-Model) Pattern.

Along with native android data binding, libraries used to achieve MVVM pattern are retrofit (to
consume api data) and reactivex (reactive programming).

This app gets dummy json data from http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums/1/photos and displays
it in recycler view.
App shows detail view after clicking on single item.
